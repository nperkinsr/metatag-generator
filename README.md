# Metatag Generator
**Meta Tag Generator** is a practical tool designed to help users craft and preview the meta tags that affect how their website appears on search engines and social media previews. The form includes 10 fields covering elements like the page title, description, image URL, site name, and more — all aimed at improving Google snippets and rich link previews (like on Twitter or Facebook).

As users fill out or update the fields, a live preview card instantly updates, showing what the final result will look like when shared or indexed. Once satisfied with the preview, clicking the **Generate** button creates the appropriate <meta> tags, ready to be copied and pasted into the <head> of any HTML document.

This project was built to practise form input handling, live DOM updates, and generating dynamic HTML code from user input — all wrapped into a user-friendly, visually guided experience.
